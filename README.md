# OpenAI

If you are like me, I like writing prompts to kick off my creativty. These writing prompts are especially useful when having to write a professional description about your previous roles. I've created a script to ease any writer's block you may have!  
There are some websites out there with this kind of concept but i find they don't have the robust feedback and damn near conciseness that OpenAI displays.
This project incorporates [OpenAIs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) 
Davinci-001 model to:
* write a LinkedIn profile description based off of a small portion of text about yourself
* ingest text from a PDF resume and adapt it to meet the job description of your choice

## Prerequisits:
For ease of working between programming and writing I use Jupyter Notebooks thru the writing prompts.

## Files:
`StartResume.ipynb`. --> You'll want to use this file as a starting point, as I mentioned above, you'll have to give details about yourself.  I'm broken it down into a few intriguing questions.
